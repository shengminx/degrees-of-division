# Degrees of Division: How Democrats and Republicans View Higher Education

This project analyzes how political affiliation influences attitudes toward higher education in the United States. Using data from the [American National Election Studies (ANES)](https://electionstudies.org), the report visualizes partisan differences in:

- Educational attainment
- Approval of college and university governance
- Sentiment toward university professors (via a 0â€“100 feelings thermometer)

The dataset was reduced from 1,910 to 1,460 respondents after filtering out individuals without a clear political affiliation.
